# PyCiphers
My not so efficient implementation of some simple ciphers and encoding, written in python.

# interface.py
A very hacky menu that ties all my code together. 

# Current Cipher/Encoding Functions
 - ROT13
 - ROT47
 - Caesar Cipher
 - Affine Encode (Will add decode function soon!)
 - Morse Code (Can encode and decode)
